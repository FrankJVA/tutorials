        <p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that tries to identify and extract opinions from a given text. The aim of sentiment analysis is to gauge the attitudes, sentiments, and emotions of a speaker/writer based on the computational treatment of subjectivity in a text. This can be in the form of like/dislike binary rating or in the form of numerical ratings from 1 to 5.</p>

        <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon. The data spans a period of more than 10 years, from Oct 1999 up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories[1]. The data consists of 568,454 reviews, 256,059 users, 74,258 products and 260 users with &gt; 50 reviews.</p>
<p>Our aim is to study these reviews and try and predict whether a review is positive or negative.</p>
<p>The data has been originally hosted by SNAP (<a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html" target="_blank">Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection</a>), a collection of more than 50 large network datasets from tens of thousands of nodes and edges to tens of millions of nodes and edges. In includes social networks, web graphs, road networks, internet networks, citation networks, collaboration networks, and communication networks [2].</p>
<p>The dataset provided is a CSV file containing 568,454 rows and a total of 10 features (columns).</p>
<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
<p>If you are using <strong>Aquarium</strong> as the environment, then the lab <strong>Driverless AI Test Drive</strong> has the Amazon fine review dataset already pre-loaded with separate training and test datasets. The datasets can be located on the Datasets Overview page. However, you can also upload the datasets externally. To learn more about how to add the two datasets from the Driveless AI file system then see [Appendix A: Add the Datasets].(#task-8-appendix-a-add-the-datasets)</p>
<p>On clicking the highlighted <code>Start lab</code> button , you will be taken  to a Driverless AI platform with several pre-loaded data sets and pre-run visualizations, models, interpretations, and deployments. Here  you will have access to both the training and testing set for Amazon fine food reviews.</p>
<p>1. Verify that both datasets are on the Datasets Overview, your screen should look similar to the page below:</p>
<p><img src="img/7d22f055d15e2679.png"></p>
<p>2. Click on the <code>AmazonFineFood_train</code> file and then on Details.</p>
<p><img src="img/50f6ce48025a0055.png"></p>
<p>3. Let&#39;s take a quick look at the columns of the training set:</p>
<p><img src="img/9d20dba16af1273.png"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<p>The dataset consists of 10 columns which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UserId</strong> - Unique identifier for the user</li>
<li><strong>ProductId</strong> - Unique identifier for the product</li>
<li><strong>Id</strong> - Row Id</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong> - Brief summary of the review</li>
<li><strong>Score</strong> - Rating between 1 and 5</li>
<li><strong>HelpfulnessDenominator</strong> - Number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not</li>
<li><strong>ProfileName</strong> - Profile name of the user<br></li>
</ul>
<p>4. Continue scrolling the current page to see more columns (image is not included)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HelpfulnessNumerator</strong> - Number of users who found the review helpful</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong> - Timestamp for the review</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - Text of the review</li>
<li><strong>Positive Review</strong> - Whether the review is Positive or Negative</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Return to the <strong>Datasets</strong> Page</p>
<h2>Launch Experiment</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the objectives, this tutorial includes a pre-ran sentiment analysis experiment which includes all the datasets that are required for the experiment.</p>
<p>1. On the Datasets page click on the <strong>AmazonFineFoodReviews-train-26k.csv</strong> dataset and select Predict</p>
<p><img src="img/d7552c1277029ec.png"></p>
<p>2. As soon as you select the <code>Predict</code> option, you are asked for a tour of Driverless AI environment. Skip it for now by clicking <code>Not Now</code>. However, it is recommended to get the intuitive tour incase you are new to the environment. An image similar to the one below should appear.</p>
<p><img alt="Task-1/5-initial-experiment" src="img/8e1ff08035a18a1a.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Next, you will need to feed in the following information into Driverless AI :</p>
<p><img src="img/35a6117510e30b0a.png"></p>
<p>4. <strong>Display Name</strong> - Give a name to your expeiment. You can choose according to your choice but it is recommended to choose a name that highlights the purpose of the experiment. Let&#39;s name our current experiment as <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Target Column</strong> -  The <em>Target column</em> contains the value that we intend to predict through the experiment. Click on the <code>Select Target Column</code> tab and select <strong>Positive Review</strong> as the target column. The aim of the experiment is to try to predict whether a fiven review is positive or negative, hence the Positive Review is selected as the target column. The column has only two values i.e Positive and Negative.</p>
<p><img src="img/ca6400140c9790c6.png"></p>
<p>6. <strong>Test Dataset</strong> -  The <em>Test dataset</em> is a dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a <em>final</em> model fit on the training dataset. It is not used during training of the model and results are available at the end of the experiment. Select the <code>AmazonFineFoodReviews-test-26k.csv</code> dataset as follows:</p>
<p><img src="img/4036da3ee0ebf6b.png"></p>
<p>7. <strong>Dropped Columns</strong> - The <em>Dropped Columns</em> feature enable us to  drop column(s) from your dataset that you don&#39;t want to use in the experiment.For this experiment we shall only use the text columns so we shall drop all columns that are not in text format.</p>
<p><img src="img/993dd0d7e570c33d.png"></p>
<p>However, please note that you can also choose to keep the non-text columns and NLP algorithms will work on that too.</p>
<p>The experiment screen will finally look like the image below:</p>
<p><img src="img/210cd9de7f2df88c.png"></p>
<p>In <strong>Task 2</strong>, we shall explore and update the Experiment Settings.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 2: Sentiment Analysis Experiment Settings" duration="0">
        <p>Once the data has been imported into Driverless AI, there are certain experiment settings that need to be updated. This section deals with experiment settings with respect to NLP tasks. However, if you wish to learn more about the meaning and various experimental settings in general , It is recommender to go through the following tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-tutorial-financial-focus/#3" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis Tutorial - Financial Focus</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>Experiment Settings describe the Accuracy, Time and Interpretability of a specific experiment. The knobs on the experiment settings are adjustable. As values change, the meaning of the settings on the left-bottom page change.</p>
<p>Here are the following settings that need to be updated for a typical NLP experiment.</p>
<p><img src="img/b8b503d471b65953.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Interpretability</li>
<li>Scorer</li>
<li>Expert Settings</li>
</ol>
<h2>Accuracy</h2>
<p>Accuracy stands for relative accuracy i.e higher values, should lead to higher confidence in model performance (accuracy). The accuracy setting impacts which algorithms are considered, level of assembling and types of feature engineering,</p>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>Time is the Relative time for completing the experiment. Higher values will take longer for the experiment to complete.</p>
<h2>Interpretability</h2>
<p>Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of the decision. It controls the complexity of the models and features allowed within the experiments (e.g. higher interpretability will generally block complicated features, feature engineering, and models).</p>
<h2>Scorer</h2>
<p>Scorer is the metric used to Evaluate the machine learning algorithm. The scorer used for this experiment is the LogLoss or logarithmic loss metric which is used to used to evaluate the performance of a binomial or multinomial classifier. Unlike AUC which looks at how well a model can classify a binary target, logloss evaluates how close a model&#39;s predicted values (uncalibrated probability estimates) are to the actual target value. The lower the Logloss value the better the better the model can predict the sentiment.</p>
<h2>Expert Settings</h2>
<p>Expert Settings can be tuned according to the type of experiment. To tune the NLP settings, click on the Expert settings and navigate to the NLP option :</p>
<p><img src="img/e786373fc6c0f002.png"></p>
<p>Click on the NLP tab to enable NLP specific settings as shown below. This option allows you to specify whether to build <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> models as part of the experiment (usually only for text features engineering and for the final model unless it&#39;s used exclusively). Enable these options for NLP experiments.</p>
<p><img src="img/863e27c413cf456f.png"></p>
<p>Additionally, there are three buttons located beneath the experimental settings knob which stand for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification or Regression : Driverless AI automatically determines the problem type based on the response column. Though not recommended, you can override this setting by clicking this button. Our current problem is that of Classification.</li>
<li>Reproducible: This button allows you to build an experiment with a random seed and get reproducible results. If this is disabled (default), the results will vary between runs.</li>
<li>Enable GPUs: Specify whether to enable GPUs. (Note that this option is ignored on CPU-only systems.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Update the following experiment settings so that they match the image below, then select Launch Experiment. This configuration is selected to generate a model quickly with a sufficient level of accuracy in the H2O Driverless Test Drive environment.</p>
<p><img src="img/f1bf3c9e4c46e2c1.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: 5</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: 2</li>
<li><strong>Interpretability</strong>: 5</li>
<li><strong>Scorer</strong>: LogLoss</li>
</ul>
<p>This experiment will run between 50 minutes and 1 hour. However, the time taken depends on the memory and availability of GPU in a system. If the system do not have a GPU, it might run for a longer time.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 3: Natural Language Processing Concepts" duration="0">
        <h2>Natural Language Processing(NLP)</h2>
<p>NLP is the field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers. NLP sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics[1]. NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as :</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic tagging of incoming customer queries related to credit card, loans etc</li>
<li>Sentiment analysis of Social media reviews</li>
<li>Using free text variables along with numeric variables for credit risk, fraud models.</li>
<li>Emotion detection</li>
<li>Profanity detection</li>
</ul>
<p>The text data is highly unstructured but the Machine learning algorithms usually work with input features that are numeric in nature. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process and normalize the text to make it ideal for feeding into the commonly available Machine learning algorithms. This essentially means we need to build a pipeline of some sort that breaks down the problem into several pieces. We can then apply various methodologies on these pieces and plug the solution together in the form of a pipeline.</p>
<h2>Building a Typical NLP Pipeline</h2>
<p><img src="img/97b29e2b1deef178.png"></p>
<p>The figure above shows how a typical pipeline looks like. It is also important to note that there may be variations depending upon the problem at hand. Hence the pipeline will have to be adjusted to suit our needs. Driverless AI automates the above process. Let&#39;s try and understand some of the components of the pipeline in brief:</p>
<h2>Text preprocessing</h2>
<p>Text pre-processing involves using a variety of techniques to convert raw text into well- defined sequences of linguistic components that have standard structure and notation. Some of those techniques are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentence Segmentation :</strong> involves identifying sentence boundaries between words in different sentences. Since most written languages have punctuation marks which occur at sentence boundaries, sentence segmentation is frequently referred to as sentence boundary detection, sentence boundary disambiguation, or sentence boundary recognition. All these terms refer to the same task: determining how a text should be divided into sentences for further processing.</li>
<li><strong>Text Tokenization :</strong> Tokenization involves splitting raw text corpus into sentences and then further splitting each sentence into words.</li>
<li><strong>Text Standardisation:</strong> Once the text has been tokenized, it is normalised by getting rid of the noise. Noise relates to anything that isn&#39;t in a standard format like punctuation marks, special characters or any unwanted tokens. If required, case conversions can also be done i.e converting all tokens into either lowercase or uppercase.</li>
<li><strong>Removing Stopwords:</strong> Stop words are words which appear very frequently in a text like &#34;and&#34;, &#34;the&#34;, and &#34;a&#34; but appear to be of little value in helping select documents. Such words are excluded from the vocabulary entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Stemming:</strong> Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: &#34;Stems&#34;, &#34;Stemming&#34;, &#34;Stemmed&#34;, &#34;and Stemtization&#34;, the result would be a single token &#34;stem&#34;.</li>
<li><strong>Lemmatization :</strong> a similar operation to stemming is lemmatization. However, the major difference between the two is that stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmatization creates actual words. An example of lemmatization: &#34;run&#34; is a base form for words like &#34;running&#34; or &#34;ran&#34; and the word &#34;better&#34; and &#34;good&#34; are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note here that the above steps are not mandatory and their usage depends upon the use case. For instance, in sentiment analysis emoticons signify polarity and stripping them off from the text may not be a good idea. The general goal of the Normalization, Stemming and Lemmatization techniques is to improve the generalization of the model. Essentially we are mapping different variants of what we consider to be the same or very similar &#34;word&#34; to one token in our data.</p>
<h2>Feature Extraction</h2>
<p>The Machine Learning Algorithms usually expect features in the form of numeric vectors . Hence, after the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform the text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. This process is called <strong>feature extraction</strong>. Let&#39;s see how some of the feature-extracting techniques work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bag of Words :</strong> The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:<ul>
<li>A vocabulary of known words</li>
<li>A measure of the presence of known words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content and we can get an idea about the meaning of the document from its content alone.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model" target="_blank">Example implementation</a></h2>
<p>The following models a text document using bag-of-words. Here are two simple text documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.</li>
<li>John also likes to watch football games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these two text documents, a list is constructed as follows for each document:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;John&#34;,&#34;likes&#34;,&#34;to&#34;,&#34;watch&#34;,&#34;movies&#34;,&#34;Mary&#34;,&#34;likes&#34;,&#34;movies&#34;,&#34;too&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;John&#34;,&#34;also&#34;,&#34;likes&#34;,&#34;to&#34;,&#34;watch&#34;,&#34;football&#34;,&#34;games&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Representing each bag-of-words as a JSON object, and attributing to the respective JavaScript variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>BoW1 = {&#34;John&#34;:1,&#34;likes&#34;:2,&#34;to&#34;:1,&#34;watch&#34;:1,&#34;movies&#34;:2,&#34;Mary&#34;:1,&#34;too&#34;:1};</li>
<li>BoW2 = {&#34;John&#34;:1,&#34;also&#34;:1,&#34;likes&#34;:1,&#34;to&#34;:1,&#34;watch&#34;:1,&#34;football&#34;:1,&#34;games&#34;:1};</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that BoW does not retain word order and is sensitive towards document length, i.e token frequency counts could be higher for longer documents.</p>
<p>It is also possible to create BoW models with combination of consecutive words, also known as n-grams.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TF-IDF Model:</strong> A problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much &#34;informational content&#34;. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than the shorter ones. One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words across all documents are penalized. This approach of scoring is called  <strong>Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</strong>, or TF-IDF [2] for short, where:<ul>
<li><strong>Term Frequency</strong>  is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.TF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)</li>
<li><strong>Inverse Document Frequency</strong>: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.IDF = 1+log(N/n), where N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.TF-IDF weight is often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/dcfd44a9173da5dd.png"></p>
<p>The dimensions of the output vectors are high. This also gives importance to the rare terms that occur in the corpus which might be helpful in our classification tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Principal Component Analysis s a dimension reduction tool that can be used to reduce a large set of variables to a small set that still contains most of the information in the original set</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Truncated SVD<br></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>SVD stands for Singular Value Decomposition[3] which is a way to decompose matrices. Truncated SVD is a common method to reduce the dimension for text-based frequency/vectors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Word Vectorization Models<br></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>TFIDF and frequency-based models represent counts and significant word information, but they lack semantics of the words in general. One of the popular representations of text to overcome this is Word Embeddings.</p>
<p>Word embeddings is a feature engineering technique for text where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.There are ways to create more advanced word vectorization models for extracting features from text data like word2vec[2]  model. Released in 2013 by Google, word2vec is a neural network-based implementation that learns distributed vector representations of words based on continuous Bag of Words and skip-gram–based architectures</p>
<p><img src="img/778c1b0e9843a293.png"></p>
<p>Representations are made in such a way that words that have similar meanings are placed close or equidistant to each other. For example, words like ‘king&#39; is closely associated with &#34;queen&#34; in this vector representation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convolution neural network(CNN) models on word embeddings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>CNN&#39;s are generally used in computer vision, however, they&#39;ve recently been applied on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks and the results were promising[5].</p>
<p>Word embeddings can be passed as inputs to CNN models, and cross-validated predictions are obtained from it. These predictions can then be used as new set of features.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp" target="_blank">Image Reference</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recurrent neural networks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RNNs like LSTM and GRU are state of the art algorithms for NLP problems. Simply, put a Bi-directional GRU model is putting two independent RNN models in one.</p>
<p>For example, in the sentence &#34;John is walking golf court&#34;, a unidirectional model would represent states with representing &#34;golf&#34; based on &#34;John is walking&#34; but not the &#34;court&#34;. Using a bi-directional model, the representation would also account the later representations giving the model more predictive power.</p>
<p>This makes it a more ‘natural&#39; approach when dealing with textual data since the text is naturally sequential[6].</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 4: Driverless AI NLP Recipe" duration="0">
        <p>Text data can contain critical information to inform better predictions. H2O Driverless AI automatically converts text strings into features using powerful techniques like TFIDF, CNN, and GRU. With TensorFlow, Driverless AI can also process larger text blocks and build models using all available data to solve business problems like sentiment analysis, document classification and content tagging. In particular, Driverless AI implements the following recipes and models.</p>
<p><img src="img/3f5c0c4ec9690d7f.png"></p>
<h2>Key Capabilities of Driverless AI NLP Recipe</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>TFIDF of n-grams</strong>: Frequency-based features are multiplied with inverse document frequency to get TFIDF vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency of n-grams</strong>: Frequency-based features represent the count of each word in the given text in the form of vectors. Frequency-based features are created for different n-gram values[2]. The dimensions of the output vectors are quite high. Words/n-grams that occur more number of times will get higher weightage than the ones that occur less frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Truncated SVD Features</strong>: Both TFIDF and Frequency of n-grams result in a higher dimension. To tackle this, we use Truncated SVD to decompose the vector arrays in lower dimensions.</li>
<li><strong>Linear models on TF/IDF vectors</strong>: In our NLP recipe, we also have linear models on top of n-gram TFIDF / frequency vectors. This capture linear dependencies that are simple yet significant in achieving the best accuracies.</li>
<li><strong>Word Embeddings</strong>: Driverless AI NLP recipe makes use of the power of word embeddings where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Bi-direction GRU models on word embeddings</strong>: A Bi-directional GRU model is like putting two independent RNN models in one. Taking note of accuracy as well as speed in our experiments, we have decided to take advantage of high speed and almost similar accuracies of GRU architecture compared to its counterpart LSTM.</li>
<li><strong>Convolution neural network models on:</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>word embeddings</strong>: In Driverless AI, we pass word embeddings as input to CNN models, get cross-validated predictions from it and use them as a new set of features.</li>
<li><strong>CNN models on character embeddings</strong>: Natural language processing is complex as the language is hard to understand given small data and different languages.Targeting languages like Japanese, Chinese where characters play a major role, we have character level embeddings in our recipe as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In character embeddings, each character gets represented in the form of vectors rather than words. Driverless AI uses character level embeddings as input to CNN models and later extract class probabilities to feed as features for downstream models. This gives the ability to work in languages other than English also. In case of languages like Japanese, Chinese etc where there is no concept of words, character embeddings will be useful.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 7: Challenge" duration="0">
        <p>It&#39;s time to test your skills!</p>
<p>The challenge is to analyze and perform Sentiment Analysis on the tweets using the US Airline Sentiment dataset. This will help to gauge people&#39;s sentiments about each of the major U.S. airline.</p>
<p>This data comes from  <a href="http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone" target="_blank">Crowdflower&#39;s Data for Everyone library</a>  and constitutes twitter reviews about how travellers in February 2015 expressed their feelings on Twitter about every major U.S. airline. The reviews have been classified as positive, negative, and neutral.</p>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<p>1. Import the dataset from here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://airline-sentiment-2-w-aa/" target="_blank">Airline-Sentiment-2-w-AA</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some samples from the dataset:</p>
<p><img src="img/7595f43924eb8589.png"></p>
<p>2. Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set in 80:20 ratio.</p>
<p>3. Run an experiment where the target column is &#34;<strong>airline_sentiment</strong>&#34; using only the default Transformers. You can exclude all other columns from the dataset except the ‘text&#39; column.</p>
<p>4. Run another instance of the same experiment but this time also include Tensorflow models in addition to the built in transformers.</p>
<p>5. Next, repeat the experiment with a custom recipe from <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/driverlessai-recipes/blob/master/README.md#sample-recipes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>6. Using Logloss as the scorer, observe the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which experiment out of the three gives the minimum Logloss value and why?</li>
<li>How variable importance changes as you change the selected transformers.</li>
