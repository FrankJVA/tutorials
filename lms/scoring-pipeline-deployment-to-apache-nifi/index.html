        <p><strong>Machine Learning Model Deployment</strong> is the process of making your model available in production environments, so they can be used to make predictions for other software systems [1]. Before model deployment, <strong>feature engineering</strong> occurs in the form of preparing data that later on will be used to train a model [2]. Driverless AI <strong>Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)</strong> combines the best feature engineering and one or more <strong>machine learning models</strong> into a scoring pipeline [3][4]. The scoring pipeline is used to score or predict data when given new test data [5]. The <strong>scoring pipeline</strong> comes in two flavors. The first scoring pipeline is a <strong>Model Object, Optimized (MOJO) Scoring Pipeline</strong>, which is a standalone, low-latency model object designed to be easily embeddable in production environments. The second scoring pipeline is a Python Scoring Pipeline, which has a heavy footprint that is all Python and uses the latest libraries of Driverless AI to allow for executing custom scoring recipes[6].</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial, you will predict the <strong>cooling condition</strong> for a Hydraulic System Test Rig by deploying an <strong>embeddable MOJO Scoring Pipeline</strong> to <strong>Apache NiFi</strong>. The Hydraulic System Test Rig data comes from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems#" target="_blank">UCI Machine Learning Repository: Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems Data Set</a>. Hydraulic System Test Rigs are used to test components in Aircraft Equipment, Ministry of Defense, Automotive Applications, and more [7]. This Hydraulic Test Rig is capable of testing a range of flow rates that can achieve different pressures with the ability to heat and cool to simulate testing under different conditions [8]. Testing the pressure, volume flow, and the temperature is possible by Hydraulic Test Rig sensors and digital displays.. The display panel alerts the user when certain testing criteria is met displaying either a green/red light [8]. A filter blockage panel indicator is integrated into the panel to ensure the Hydraulic Test Rig&#39;s oil is maintained [8]. The cooling filtration solution is designed to minimize power consumption and expand the life of the Hydraulic Test Rig. We are predicting cooling conditions for Hydraulic System Predictive Maintenance. When the cooling condition is low, our prediction tells us that the cooling of the Hydraulic System is close to total failure and we may need to look into replacing the cooling filtration solution soon.</p>

<p>The Hydraulic Test Rig consists of a primary and secondary cooling filtration circuit with pumps that deliver flow and pressure to the oil tank. The oil tank box at the bottom. There is a pressure relief control valve for controlling the rising and falling flows. There is a pressure gauge for measuring the pressure.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 2: NiFi and MOJO Scoring Pipeline Concepts" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Embedding the MOJO into a Custom NiFi Processor</h2>
<p>If you have gone through the earlier scoring pipeline deployment tutorials, you have seen one particular way we deploy the MOJO Scoring Pipeline is to a server or serverless instance and there is some client that interacts with the server to trigger it to execute the MOJO to make predictions. An alternative way to deploy the MOJO Scoring Pipeline is to embed it directly into the Java Runtime Environment where your Apache NiFi application is running. With NiFi, we would take advantage of NiFi&#39;s custom processor extensibility and build a custom NiFi processor that uses the MOJO Java API to load the MOJO and perform predictions on the data passing through the processor and output the results to the remaining processors in the NiFi Data Flow. We will be going over the custom MOJO NiFi processor built for this tutorial.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Open Custom NiFi Processor Code in Eclipse IDE</h2>
<p>If you want to add or update the Java code for the NiFi processor, you can open your favorite IDE, then import the project. Let&#39;s walk through the steps to open the project in Eclipse:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd $HOME/dai-deployment-examples/mojo-nifi/model-deployment/apps/nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-h2o-record-bundle/

# Download the JAR package dependencies for the Eclipse project
mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSource=true
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Import the NiFi processor project </strong><code>$HOME/dai-deployment-examples/mojo-nifi/model-deployment/apps/nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-h2o-record-processors/</code> in Eclipse:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="nifi-processor-dev-eclipse-ide" src="img/f00fb36cb62daf06.jpg"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Process For Developing the Custom NiFi Processor</h2>
<p>For developing the custom NiFi processor, you can use Maven and Eclipse IDE. When using NiFi with Maven, there is the option to build a starter template for the custom processor you are going to build. To generate the starter template, you can use the following command: <code>mvn archetype:generate</code>. Next we are ready to work on the processor&#39;s code in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In this tutorial, we briefly look at the steps to open and compile the Java code in Eclipse. Ypu can run the command <code>mvn install</code> to compile the project. Then you can run <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSource=true</code> to download the JARs needed for the project and so Eclipse would be aware of them. Then one opens Eclipse and imports the NiFi processor project folder <a href="https://github.com/james94/dai-deployment-examples/blob/mojo-nifi/mojo-nifi/model-deployment/apps/nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-h2o-record-bundle/nifi-h2o-record-processors" target="_blank">nifi-h2o-record-processors/</a> into Eclipse.</p>
<p>While writing the code for the NiFi processor <a href="https://github.com/james94/dai-deployment-examples/blob/mojo-nifi/mojo-nifi/model-deployment/apps/nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-h2o-record-bundle/nifi-h2o-record-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/h2o/record/ExecuteDaiMojoScoringPipeline.java" target="_blank">ExecuteDaiMojoScoringPipeline.java</a>, the following package dependencies for using NiFi&#39;s Record Reader, NiFi&#39;s Record Writer and H2O&#39;s MOJO2 Runtime were required. So the <em>nifi-h2o-record-processors/</em> folder&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/james94/dai-deployment-examples/blob/mojo-nifi/mojo-nifi/model-deployment/apps/nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-h2o-record-bundle/nifi-h2o-record-processors/pom.xml" target="_blank">pom.xml</a> was updated to be able to use these dependencies. Once these new dependencies are added to the <em>pom.xml</em>, you must run the following command mvn <code>eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSource=true</code> to download them for use in the Eclipse project. Once all the Java code was written for the processor, the code was compiled with command: <code>mvn install</code>. When the code compiled successfully, a Junit test was written in Java <a href="https://github.com/james94/dai-deployment-examples/blob/mojo-nifi/mojo-nifi/model-deployment/apps/nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-h2o-record-bundle/nifi-h2o-record-processors/src/test/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/h2o/record/TestExecuteDaiMojoScoringPipeline.java" target="_blank">TestExecuteDaiMojoScoringPipeline.java</a> for testing multiple properties and test cases for the processor. The code was recompiled and a NiFi Archive (NAR) was generated. We will talk more about the NAR soon.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Add Custom NiFi Processor to NiFi Product</h2>
<p>Once you have compiled the NiFi custom processor, a NAR file will be generated. A NAR allows several components and their dependencies to be packaged together into a single package. The NAR package is provided ClassLoader isolation from other NAR packages, so when software from many different organizations is all hosted within the same environment, the Java ClassLoaders will not be an issue.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Build a NiFi Flow to do Interactive or Batch Scoring</h2>
<p>You could build a NiFi flow from scratch with the custom processor <strong>ExecuteDaiMojoScoringPipeline</strong> to do interactive scoring or batch scoring. You would need at least a processor to ingest the source of data, the MOJO processor to perform predictions on the data and another processor to send the predicted results to a destination.</p>
<p>To make it easier to see how to run the MOJO in the NiFi flow, we will use NiFi flow templates. A NiFi flow template is a flow that has already been built to ingest data, perform transformations on the data, and send the data somewhere. There are two NiFi flow templates that have been created: one that can do interactive (real-time) scoring and the other one that can do batch scoring. It just depends on the data you are ingesting into the flow. If you ingest tabular data that has only 1 row of data in each file, then the <strong>ExecuteDaiMojoScoringPipeline</strong> will do interactive scoring. If you ingest tabular data that has multiple rows of data in each file, then the <strong>ExecuteDaiMojoScoringPipeline</strong> will do batch scoring. However, behind the scenes, even if the tabular data contains multiple rows, the NiFi processor iterates over each individual row and performs the prediction on each row.</p>
<p>For reference, here is the path to the two NiFi flow templates:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># NiFi Flow Template for batch scoring
$HOME/dai-deployment-examples/mojo-nifi/model-deployment/apps/nifi/templates/predBatchesHydCoolCond.xml
