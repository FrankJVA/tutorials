        <p>We believe that every company can and should be an AI company. This is a fundamental concept for the future of every business and organization today. As you embark on this AI journey to make your own AI, we want you to explore the key considerations as well as the technology that will make your own AI a possibility.</p>
<p>To make your own AI, with an automatic machine learning platform, it needs to be open and extensible. This allows data scientists to influence the automatic machine learning optimization process and for it to consider additional feature engineering, custom scorers, and other algorithms. Data scientists can add their insights, customizations, and build the most accurate models for their use cases. Driverless AI uses the concept of recipes to optimize the machine learning process, and with Driverless AI 1.7.0 and newer versions users can add custom recipes and develop new recipes.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will cover what a recipe is, the different types of recipes available, and how to upload existing recipes to Driverless AI through the URL option. The three types of custom recipes that will be covered are transformer, scorer, and model.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 1: Introduction to Driverless AI Bring Your Own Recipe" duration="0">
        <p>H2O Driverless AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform for automatic machine learning. Driverless AI automates some of the most difficult and tedious data science and machine learning tasks such as feature engineering, algorithm selection, model validation, model tuning, model selection, model explanation, model documentation and model deployment. It aims to achieve the highest predictive accuracy, comparable to expert data scientists, but in a much shorter time thanks to end-to-end automation. The current scope of Driverless AI does not include extensive data manipulation or augmentation before starting an experiment, hence most of the data preparation needs to be done before loading the data.</p>
<p>In Driverless AI, a pipeline (which we call an experiment) is made up of building blocks, or recipes, that produce a model. These recipes are Python code snippets. Recipes have the following types: ML algorithms, feature engineering (transformers), scorers, and configuration. In Driverless AI 1.7.0, we added support for BYOR (Bring Your Own Recipe). With BYOR, you can use your own recipes in combination with or instead of all built-in recipes. This allows you to influence the Driverless AI Automatic ML pipeline and gives you control over the optimization choices that Driverless AI makes.</p>
<p>Recipes can be uploaded into Driverless AI at runtime without having to restart Driverless AI, just like a plugin. There are already close to 100 open-source recipes that have been created by H2O and curated in the recipe library by data science experts that can be used as-is or as templates and expanded upon.</p>
<p>Existing recipes include templates for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transformers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scorers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Models</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The various types of templates and how to use them will be described in the remaining tasks of the tutorial.</p>
<h2>How do recipes work in Driverless AI?</h2>
<p>During the training of a supervised machine learning modeling pipeline, Driverless AI can use the recipes or code snippets as building blocks, independent or in combination with all built-in code pieces. The recipes act the same way as if it was written by H2O. It&#39;s the same python code and backend, so there is no performance penalty.</p>
<p>Below is a diagram of how recipes work in Driverless AI and how the Automatic Model Optimization process is extended:</p>
<p><img alt="dai-byor-how-it-works" src="img/19c0e46d6cf96f0d.jpg"></p>
<p>The image below is a deeper dive into the <strong>BYOR</strong> architecture for a multi-class problem:</p>
<p><img alt="dai-byor-architecture-diagram-1" src="img/eed8ff3f17393b90.jpg"></p>
<p>The diagram above focuses on the parts of Driverless AI that are relevant to the <strong>BYOR</strong> architecture. Automatic Visualization and Machine Learning Interpretability are not covered in this diagram. The diagram is the architecture representing a multi-class problem, but binary classification and regression problems are also supported.</p>
<h2>What is the role of recipes in ML?</h2>
<p><strong>BYOR</strong> allows data Scientists to bring their own recipes or leverage the existing open-source recipes to manipulate, augment, and optimize their data. In this way, the expertise of those creating and using the recipes is leveraged to focus on domain-specific functions to build customizations.</p>
<h2>Where can you find the H2O open-source recipes?</h2>
<p>The curated open-source recipes currently reside on the following GitHub repository:</p>

<p><img alt="exp1-accuracy" src="img/f2401dbd5ddb8d4a.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Under summary</strong>: The validation score is .91046 with an accuracy of .9391 (click on ROC then hover over Best ACC)</li>
<li><strong>Variable Importance</strong>: The top variables that led to a customer churning according to this model was the number of times the customer had to call customer service. The other variable of most importance was the total amount a customer was being charged for their &#34;day calls.&#34; Intuitively this makes sense because if a customer is overpaying for calls in the morning when they might be the most active and they had to call customer service many times, it could have led a dissatisfied customer.Ne</li>

<p>When a dataset is selected for an experiment, Driverless AI optimizes its settings by selecting the best Scorer, Model(s) and Transformers for the dataset. However, this does not mean we cannot import other scorer&#39;s, models or transformers to see if we can further optimize our model. In this task, we will be importing a transformer recipe, to see how the features in the feature engineering change.</p>
<p>Now we are going to import a recipe to add related numeric features such as day minutes, evening minutes, and night minutes. Driverless AI doesn&#39;t add 3 or more columns so we will add a recipe that will do this for us. We will see if Driverless AI is able to use this new transformation in determining variable importance.</p>
<h2>Import a Transformer Recipe</h2>
<p>The goal of importing the new transformer recipe is to see if we can further optimize our baseline model. To do this, we are going to take our baseline experiment and import the <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/driverlessai-recipes/blob/master/transformers/numeric/sum.py" target="_blank">sum.py transformer</a></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 6: Comparing Final Model Results" duration="0">
        <p>So far we ran four experiments, a baseline, and the baseline with three different types of recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driverless AI default settings</li>
<li>Transformer</li>
<li>Scorer</li>
<li>Model</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are going to compare the results of all the experiments through the <strong>Projects</strong> feature which allows us to compare the final models for each experiment:</p>
<p>1. Click on <strong>Projects</strong></p>
<p><img alt="projects-select" src="img/275accb9b914cce7.jpg"></p>
<p>2. Select <strong>+New Project</strong></p>
<p>3. Enter the following under:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<pre><code>Customer Churn Recipe Comparison
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<pre><code>Comparison of customer churn experiments using various recipes.
</code></pre>
<p>4. Select <strong>Create a New Project</strong></p>
<p><img alt="create-project" src="img/437f39e9f6301c64.jpg"></p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>+Link Experiment</strong></p>
<p><img alt="projects-link-experiment" src="img/ff3bee5b523484ac.jpg"></p>
<p>6. Select <strong>Exp 1 - Baseline</strong> by clicking on the Model</p>
<p><img alt="project-select-exp1" src="img/a6c0adce888f15a8.jpg"></p>
<p>7. Repeat step 6 for the remaining models (2,3, and 4), the <strong>Project</strong> page should look similar to the one below:</p>
<p><img alt="projects-all-models-selected" src="img/b0be050f5c9e311a.jpg"></p>
<p>8. Select Exp 1, 2 and 3 to compare by clicking on the select box to the left of each model then on <strong>Compare 3 Items</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="project-select-models-to-compare" src="img/5ade92524aec5723.jpg"></p>
<p>9. A similar page will appear with the three model results:</p>
<p><img alt="project-model-comparison1" src="img/67f19f854e8485c5.jpg"></p>
<p>ROC Curves for each model selected:</p>
<p><img alt="project-model-comparison2" src="img/5ba83cd48bce9c8a.jpg"></p>
<p>We can see that when we used the Transformer recipe, the model had better AUC with an accuracy of .9670 compared to Exp 1 - Baseline, which had an accuracy of .9547. Even with Exp 3 - Scorer, although the AUC did not significantly improve, there was an improvement in the accuracy with .9690. However, we do not see much difference in the variables selected to have the largest contibution to customer churning. In the above varibale importance, we can not see how Driverless AI used the Sum transformer, but we do see how it slightly improved the scores. Below you can see how the Sum transformer was used in another experiment with similar settings, where it added the following three columns: Day Charge, Intl calls, and Intl charge.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 7: Appendix A: How to Access Driverless AI Custom Recipes" duration="0">
        <p>H2O custom recipes reside in the H2O Driverless AI Recipes GitHub repo. <strong>There are multiple branches of Driverless AI recipes so make sure that you are using the same branch as the Driverless AI version you have.</strong></p>
<p>For this tutorial, we are using <strong>Driverless AI 1.8.0</strong>, therefore, we will be working off the Driverless AI 1.8.0 branch.</p>
<p>1. Open the link below on a separate tab. Make sure the branch is <strong>rel-1.8.0</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/h2oai/driverlessai-recipes/tree/rel-1.8.0" target="_blank">H2O Driverless AI Recipes GitHub Repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The rel-1.8.0 branch will similar to the page below:</p>
<p><img alt="dai-recipes-github-page" src="img/a424a7d4ff079931.jpg"></p>
<p>2. Recipes can be uploaded to Driverless AI by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uploading custom recipes from your local machine</li>
<li>Loading custom recipes from URL, by copying and pasting the raw URL as shown on this tutorial.</li>
<li>Going to the official recipes (external) repo and search for the recipe that you need.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="upload-recipes" src="img/ecbb0a14928a253d.jpg"></p>
<h2>Uploading Recipes via the Raw URL</h2>
<p>We are going to get the raw URL for <strong>Brier Loss</strong> Scorer we used in Task 4 and upload it to Driverless AI.</p>
<p>1. Select the folder titled <strong>scorer</strong></p>
<p><img alt="dai-scorers-folder" src="img/9c32616ea374fd21.jpg"></p>
<p>2. Select the folder titled <strong>classification</strong> then the folder titled <strong>binary</strong></p>
<p><img alt="dai-classification-folder" src="img/7cfd47ffad3d9fb9.jpg"></p>

</ul>
<p>2. Make sure it is Branch rel-1-8-0, then click on <strong>Clone or Download</strong>, then on <strong>Download ZIP</strong>. This will download the entire rel1-8.0 repo to your desktop. If you prefer not to download the entire repo then use the URL method.</p>
<p><img alt="dai-recipes-repo-download" src="img/bd56402b6a9fa774.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Unzip the driverless-recipes-rel-1.8.0 file and save it on your local machine your directory of choice.</p>
<p>4. On Driverless AI, start an Experiment, then select Expert Settings. Now instead of selecting <strong>+Load Custom Recipe From URL</strong>, you will select <strong>+Upload Custom Recipe</strong></p>
<p><img alt="dai-upload-custom-recipe" src="img/7145ac74cc4e4e3f.jpg"></p>
<p>5. After you click on <strong>Upload Custom Recipe</strong>, go to the directory where you saved the <strong>driverlessai-recipes-rel-1-8-0</strong> folder</p>
<p>6. Select the <strong>scorer</strong> folder</p>
<p><img alt="dai-recipe-repo-scorers-folder" src="img/12446b97bf88682a.jpg"></p>
<p>7. Select the <strong>classification</strong> folder, then the <strong>binary</strong> folder</p>
<p><img alt="dai-recipe-repo-classification-folder" src="img/3f5575f24551fedc.jpg"></p>
<p>8. After, select the <strong>brier_loss.py</strong> file and then <strong>Open</strong></p>
