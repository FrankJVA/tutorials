        <p>The RMS Titanic was a British commercial passenger liner that sank after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912. More than 1,500 people lost their lives from an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew members while on their way to New York City from Southampton.</p>
<p>This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 2: Automatic Machine Learning Concepts" duration="0">
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
<p>The concepts found in this section are meant to provide a high-level overview of Machine Learning. At the end of this section, you can find links to resources that offer a more in-depth explanation of the concepts covered here.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence where the focus is to create machines that can simulate human intelligence. One critical distinction between artificial intelligence and machine learning is that machine learning models &#34;learn&#34; from the data they get exposed to. Arthur Samuel a machine learning pioneer back in 1959 defined machine learning as a&#34; field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed&#34;[1]. Machine learning algorithm trains on a dataset to make predictions. These predictions are sometimes used to optimize a system or assist with decision making.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning Training</h2>
<p>The advances in technology have made it easier for data to be collected and made available.  The type of data that is available will determine the kind of training that the machine learning model can undergo. There are two types of machine learning  training, supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is when the dataset contains the output that you are trying to predict. For those cases where the predicting variable is not present it&#39;s called unsupervised learning. Both types of training define the relationship between input variables and output variables.</p>
<p>In machine learning the input variables are called <strong>features</strong> and the output variables <strong>labels</strong>. The labels, in this case, are what we are trying to predict. The goal is to take the inputs/ features and use them to come up with predictions on never-before-seen data. In linear regression, the features are the x-variables and the labels are the y-variables.</p>
<p>A machine learning model defines the relationship between features and labels. When models are trained, you can train a model by feeding it examples. Examples are a particular instance of data.  You can have two types of examples: labeled and unlabeled.<br>Labeled examples are those where the x and y values (features, labels) are known. Unlabeled examples are those where we know the x value, but we don&#39;t know what the y value is (feature,?)[1]. Your dataset is like an example; the columns that will be used for training are the features; the rows are the instances of those features. The column that you want to predict is the label.<br>Supervised learning takes labeled examples and allows a model that is being trained to learn the relationship between features and labels. The trained model is then tested with unlabeled data and it&#39;s given the opportunity to predict the y value (label) for the unlabeled data. Testing a trained model with unlabeled data is called unsupervised training [1]. Note that H2O Driverless AI creates models with labeled examples.</p>
<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
<p>A machine learning model is as good as the data that is used to train it. If you use garbage data to train your model, you will get a garbage model. With this said, before uploading a dataset into tools that will assist you with building your machine learning model such as Driverless AI, ensure that the dataset has been cleaned and prepared for training. Data preparation includes the dataset being in the correct format for what you are trying to do. Duplicates have been removed, and missing data has been fixed or removed. Additionally, a reasonable sample size to train your model has been selected (training, test and validation sets) and proper transformations have been done on the dataset such as scaling, decomposition, and aggregation otherwise known as feature engineering [2].</p>
<h2>Data Transformation</h2>
<p>Data transformation or feature engineering is the process of creating new features from the existing ones. Some data transformations include looking at all the features and identifying which features can be combined to make new ones that will be more useful to the performance of the model. For categorical features, the recommendation is for classes that have few observations to be grouped to reduce the likelihood of the model overfitting. Additionally, dummy variables are introduced for categorical features to facilitate machine learning since many algorithms cannot handle categorical features directly.  Last but not least, remove features that are not used or are redundant [3]. These are only a few suggestions when approaching feature engineering. Feature engineering is very time consuming and do its repetitive nature; it can also be very expensive. The next step in creating a model is selecting an algorithm.</p>
<h2>Algorithm Selection</h2>
<p>&#34;Machine learning algorithms are described as learning a target function (f) that best maps input variables (x) to an output variable(y): Y= f(x)&#34; [4]. In supervised learning, there are many algorithms to select from for training. The type of algorithm(s) will depend on the size of your data set, structure and the type of problem you are trying to solve.  Through trial and error, the best performing algorithms can be found for your dataset. Some of those algorithms include linear regression, classification, regression trees, random forests, naive Bayes and random forest, boosting to name a few [5].</p>
<h2>Model Training</h2>
<p>One good practice when training a machine learning model is to split up your dataset into subsets: training, validation and testing sets. A good ratio for the entire dataset is 70-15-15, 70% of the entire dataset for training, 15% for validation and the remaining 15% for testing.The training set is the data that will be used to train the model, and it needs to be big enough to get significant results from it. The validation set is the data that has been held back from the training and will be used to evaluate and adjust the hyperparameters of the trained model and hence adjust the performance. Finally, the test set is data that has also been held back and will be used to confirm the results of the final model [1].</p>
<p>Another part of model training is fitting and tuning the models. To do this hyperparameters need to be tuned and cross-validation needs to take place using only the training data. Various hyperparameters values will need to be tested. Additionally, a cross-validation loop will be set to calculate the cross-validation score for each set of hyperparameters for each algorithm. Based on the cross-validation score and hyperparameter values you can select the model for each algorithm that has been tuned with training data and test is it using your test set.  The performance of your regression model can be evaluated by performance metrics such as the Mean Square Error (MSE), ROC Curve, Prec-Recall, LIFT and Gain to name a few.</p>
<h2>What are the challenges in AI Model Development?</h2>
<p>One of the significant challenges faced in developing a single production-ready model is that it can take weeks or months to develop it. Developing a model involves feature engineering, model building, and model deployment. All tasks are very repetitive, time-consuming, require advanced knowledge of feature generation, algorithms, parameters, and model deployment. Finally, there needs to be in-depth knowledge and confidence in how the model was generated to explain and justify how the model made its decisions.</p>
<h2>What is Automated Machine Learning and why is it important?</h2>
<p>AutoML or Automated Machine Learning is the process of automating algorithm selection, feature generation, hyperparameter tuning, iterative modeling, and model assessment. AutoML tools such as H2O Driverless AI makes it easy to train and evaluate machine learning models. Automating the repetitive tasks of Machine Learning Development allows people in industry to focus on the data and the business problems they are trying to solve.</p>

<li>Change the split value to .75 by adjusting the slider to 75% or entering .75 in the section that says <em>Train/Valid Split Ratio</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The ratio of .75 was selected for this particular dataset to not generalize the model given the total size of the set.</p>
<p><strong>The training set</strong> contains 981 rows, each row representing a passenger, and 16 columns representing the attributes of each passenger.</p>
<p><strong>The Test set</strong> contains 328 rows, each row representing a passenger, and 16 attribute columns representing attributes of each passenger.</p>
<p>Verify that the three titanic datasets, titanic_test, titanic_train and titanic.csv are there:</p>
<p><img alt="three-datasets" src="img/8e5f94d7ec168760.jpg"></p>
<h2>Autoviz</h2>
<p>Now that the titanic.csv dataset has been split, we will use the <em>titanic_train</em> set for the remaining of the tutorial.</p>
<p>There are two ways to visualize the training set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on the titanic_train file, select <strong>Visualize</strong>, then click on the visualization file generated.</li>
<li>Clicking on  <strong>Autoviz</strong> located at the top of the UI page, where you will be asked for the dataset you want to visualize.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Pick a method to visualize the titanic_train dataset. A similar image should appear:</p>
<p><img alt="train-set-visualization-ready" src="img/f12f830f615dae7e.jpg"></p>
<p>Click on the titanic_train visualization, and the following screen will appear</p>
<p><img alt="train-set-visualizations" src="img/bbde66c56ce1467b.jpg"></p>
<p>Is it possible to visualize how variables on the training set are correlated? Can we determine what other variables are strongly correlated to a passenger&#39;s survival? One of the graphs that allows us to visualize the correlations between variables is the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s explore the correlation between the ‘survived&#39; variable and other variables in the dataset.</p>
<p>2. Select the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong> and then click on <strong>Help</strong> located at the lower-left corner of the graph.</p>
<p>3. Take a minute to read about the how the correlation graph was constructed and how variables are color coded to show their correlations.</p>
<p>4. Take the ‘survived&#39; variable and drag it slightly to have a better look at the other variables it has been found to be correlated to. What variables are strongly correlated with the ‘survived&#39; variable?</p>
<p><img alt="train-set-correlation-graph" src="img/d6d31388345726cc.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Help</strong> button provides an explanation of the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong>. This feature is available for all graphs.</li>
<li><strong>Download</strong> allows for a full-scale image of the graph to be downloaded</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Exit out of the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong> view by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> at the top-right corner of the graph.</p>
<p>Driverless AI  shows the graphs that are &#34;relevant&#34; aspects of the data. The following are the type of graphs available:</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 5: Launch First Experiment" duration="0">
        <p>We are going to launch our first experiment. An experiment means that we are going to generate a prediction using a dataset of our choice.</p>
<p>1. Return to  the <strong>Dataset Overview page</strong></p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>titanic_train</strong> dataset then select <strong>Predict</strong></p>
<p>If this is your first time launching an experiment, the following prompt will appear asking if you want to take a tour.</p>
<p><img alt="driverless-tour" src="img/f529b2dc2129af07.jpg"></p>
<p>If you would like to take the quick tour, select <strong>YES</strong>.<br>The quick tour will cover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the training dataset</li>
<li>Select the target column that you want Driverless AI to predict from all columns</li>
<li>Select if it is a Time Series problem or not [Time Series ON or OFF]</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Select <strong>Not Now</strong> to come back and take the tour another time.</p>
<p>4. The following  <strong>Experiment</strong> page will appear:</p>
<p><img alt="train-set-experiment-page" src="img/d30c98c9a237bb4b.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Display Name - Type the name for your experiment</li>
<li>Select Target Column - What do you want to predict?</li>
<li>Dropped Columns - Drop column(s) from your dataset that you don&#39;t want to use in the experiment</li>
<li>Validation Dataset - Select the dataset you want to validate. This set will be used to validate parameters like models, features etc.</li>
<li>Test Dataset - The dataset that will be used to test the model generated from the training dataset. It is not used during training of the model and results are available at the end of the experiment.</li>
<li>Time Column - Provides a time order(time stamps for observations)</li>
</ol>
<p>Name your experiment <code>Titanic Classification Tutorial.</code></p>
<p>Continuing on with our experiment:</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Dropped Columns</strong>, drop the the following columns: Passenger_Id, name_with_salutations, name_without_salutations, boat, body and homme.dest. Then select <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="train-set-drop-columns" src="img/ce27b52aac0f7a6d.jpg"></p>
<p>These attributes (columns) were removed to create a cleaner dataset. Attributes such as boat and body are excluded because they are clear indicators that a passenger survived and can lead to data leakage. For our experiment, the survived column will suffice to create a model.</p>
<p>A clean dataset is essential for the creation of a good predictive model. The process of data cleansing needs to be done with all datasets to rid the set of any unwanted observations, structural errors, unwanted outliers or missing data.</p>
<p>6. Select <strong>Test Dataset</strong> and then click on <strong>titanic_test</strong></p>
<p><img alt="add-test-set" src="img/c5a5824a2a9c1a0d.jpg"></p>
<p>7. Now select the <strong>Target Column</strong>. In our case, the column will be ‘survived&#39;.</p>
<p><img alt="train-set-drop-name-column" src="img/701f174a0417ec73.jpg"></p>
<p>The survived attribute was selected because as an insurance company we want to know what other attributes can contribute to the survival of passengers aboard a ship and incorporate that into our insurance rates.</p>
<p>8. Your experiment page should look similar to the one below, these are the system suggestions:</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 6: Explore Feature Engineering" duration="0">
        <p>Driverless AI performs feature Engineering on the dataset to determine the optimal representation of the data. Various stages of the features appear throughout the iteration of the data. These can be viewed by hovering over points on the Iteration Data - Validation Graph and seeing the updates on the <strong>Variable Importance</strong> section.</p>
<p><img alt="feature-engineering-1" src="img/710fa35a53e33807.jpg"></p>
<p>Transformations in Driverless AI are applied to columns in the data. The transformers create the engineered features in experiments. There are many types of transformers, below are just some of the transformers found in our dataset:</p>
<p>1. Look at some of the variables in <strong>Variable of Importance</strong> , note that some of the variables start with ‘CVTE‘ followed by a column from the dataset. Some other variables might also start with ‘_NumCatTE&#39;, ‘_CVCatNumEn&#39; or ‘_TXT&#39; depending on the experiment you run. These are the new, high-value features for our training dataset.</p>
<p>These transformations are created with the following transformers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross Validation Target Encoding Transformer: ‘_CVTargetEncode&#39;</li>
<li>Frequent Transformer: ‘Freq‘<br></li>
<li>Numeric to Categorical Target Encoding Transformer = ‘_NumCatTE&#39;</li>
<li>Categorical To Numeric Encoding= ‘_CVCatNumEn&#39;</li>
<li>Text Transformer = ‘_TXT&#39;</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete list of features used in the final model is available in the Experiment Summary artifacts. The Experiment Summary also provides a list of the original features and their estimated feature importance.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 7: Explore Experiment Results" duration="0">
        <p>Let&#39;s explore the results of the experiment. The results are found on the <strong>Experiment Summary</strong> at the left-bottom of Experiment page. The resulting plots are insights from the training and validation data. Each plot will be given an brief overview.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about each plot and the metrics derived from those plots covered in this section, then check out our next tutorial <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-tutorial-financial-focus/#0" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis Tutorial - Financial Focus</a>.</p>
<p>1. Summary</p>
<p><img alt="experiment-summary-expanded" src="img/9c77a85ff3d8cdf3.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>How many features were tested and selected?</li>
<li>How many models were trained for feature evolution?</li>
</ul>
<p>2. ROC - Receiver Operating Characteristics</p>
<p>This type of graph is called a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (or ROC curve.) It is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate for the different possible cutpoints of a diagnostic test.</p>
<p>An ROC curve is a useful tool because it only focuses on how well the model was able to distinguish between classes. &#34;AUC&#39;s can help represent the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly selected positive observation higher than a randomly selected negative observation&#34;[1].  However, for models where the prediction happens rarely a high AUC could provide a false sense that the model is correctly predicting the results.  This is where the notion of precision and recall become important.</p>
<p>The ROC curve below shows Receiver-Operator Characteristics curve stats on validation data along with the best Accuracy, FCC, and F1 values[2].</p>
<p><img alt="experiment-results-roc-graph" src="img/7853406839a6451a.jpg"></p>
<p>This ROC gives an Area Under the Curve or AUC of .8644. This tells us that the model is able to correctly classify the survivors 86.44% of the time.</p>
<p>Learn more about the ROC Curve on <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-tutorial-financial-focus/#7" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis Tutorial - Financial Focus: ROC</a>.</p>
<p>3. Prec-Recall - Precision-Recall graph</p>
<p>Prec-Recall is a complementary tool to ROC curves, especially when the dataset has a significant skew. The Prec-Recall curve plots the precision or positive predictive value (y-axis) versus sensitivity or true positive rate (x-axis) for every possible classification threshold. At a high level, we can think of precision as a measure of exactness or quality of the results while recall as a measure of completeness or quantity of the results obtained by the model. Prec-Recall measures the relevance of the results obtained by the model.</p>
<p>The Prec-Recall plot below shows the Precision-Recall curve on validation data along with the best Accuracy, FCC, and F1 values. The area under this curve is called AUCPR.</p>
<p><img alt="experiment-results-prec-recall-graph" src="img/af3799c2cb280108.jpg"></p>
<p>Similarly to the ROC curve, when we take a look at the area under the curve of the Prec-Recall Curve of AUCPR we get a value of .8234. This tells us that the model brings forth relevant results or those cases of the passengers that actually survived 81.69% of the time.</p>
<p>Learn more about the Prec-Curve Curve on <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-tutorial-financial-focus/#8" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis Tutorial - Financial Focus: Prec-Recall</a>.</p>
<p>4. Cumulative Gains Chart</p>
<p>Gain and Lift charts measure the effectiveness of a classification model by looking at the ratio between the results obtained with a trained model versus a random model(or no model)[3]. The Gain and Lift charts help us evaluate the performance of the classifier as well as answer questions such as what percentage of the dataset captured has a positive response as a function of selected percentage of a sample. Additionally, we can explore how much better we can expect do with a model compared to a random model(or no model)[4].</p>
<p>For better visualization the percentage of positive responses compared to a selected percentage sample, we use Cumulative Gains and Quantile.</p>
<p>In the Gains Chart below the x-axis shows the percentage of cases from the total number of cases in the test dataset, while the y-axis shows the percentage of positive outcomes or survivors in terms of quantiles.</p>
<p>The Cumulative Gains Chart below shows Gains stats on validation data. For example, &#34;What fraction of all observations of the positive target class are in the top predicted 1%, 2%, 10%, etc. (cumulative)?&#34; By definition, the Gains at 100% are 1.0.</p>
<p><img alt="experiment-results-gains-graph" src="img/b6e95200cf24aa8b.jpg"></p>
<p>The Gains chart above tells us that when looking at the 20% quantile the model is able to positively identify ~44% of the survivors compared to the a random model(or no model) which would be able to positively identify about ~20% of the survivors at the 20% quantile.</p>
<p>Learn more about the Cumulative Gains Chart on <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-tutorial-financial-focus/#9" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis Tutorial - Financial Focus: Cumulative Gains</a>.</p>
<p>5. Cumulative Lift Chart</p>
<p>Lift can help us answer the question of how much better one can expect to do with the predictive model compared to a random model(or no model). Lift is a measure of the effectiveness of a predictive model calculated as the ratio between the results obtained with a model and with a random model(or no model). In other words, the ratio of gain% to the random expectation % at a given quantile. The random expectation of the xth quantile is x%[4].</p>
<p>The Cumulative Lift chart shows lift stats on validation data. For example, &#34;How many times more observations of the positive target class are in the top predicted 1%, 2%, 10%, etc. (cumulative) compared to selecting observations randomly?&#34; By definition, the Lift at 100% is 1.0.</p>
<p><img alt="experiment-results-lift-graph" src="img/1bd8ae4def7856d2.jpg"></p>
<p>Learn more about the Cumulative Lift Chart on <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-tutorial-financial-focus/#10" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis Tutorial - Financial Focus: Cumulative Lift</a>.</p>
<p>6. K-S</p>
<p>Kolmogorov-Smirnov or K-S measures the performance of classification models by measuring the degree of separation between positives and negatives for validation or test data[5]. &#34;The K-S is 100 if the scores partition the population into two separate groups in which one group contains all the positives and the other all the negatives. On the other hand, If the model cannot differentiate between positives and negatives, then it is as if the model selects cases randomly from the population. The K-S would be 0. In most classification models the K-S will fall between 0 and 100, and that the higher the value, the better the model is at separating the positive from negative cases.&#34;[6].</p>
<p>K-S or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov chart measures the degree of separation between positives and negatives for validation or test data.</p>
<p>Hover over a point in the chart to view the quantile percentage and Kolmogorov-Smirnov value for that point.</p>
<p><img alt="experiment-results-gains-k-s" src="img/aa8cf83cc372b26a.jpg"></p>
<p>For the K-S chart above, if we look at the top 60% of the data, the at-chance model (the dotted diagonal line) tells us that only 60% of the data was successfully separate between positives and negatives (survived and did not survived). However, with the model it was able to do .499 or about 50% of the cases were successfully separated between positives and negatives.</p>

        <p>Using the CreditCard dataset predict whether someone will default on their Credit Card Payment.  Based on a customer&#39;s past behavior, can we predict if they will default on a credit card payment? Based on the information known at the start of a loan, can we predict if the loan will be fully paid off?</p>
<p>The dataset has the following information: information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, etc.</p>
<p>Here is the schema for the dataset:</p>
<p><img alt="creditcard-schema" src="img/5c8f6ee7d84d514f.jpg"></p>
<p>Sample set of records:</p>
<p><img alt="creditcard-sample-records" src="img/d617cfb73885a185.jpg"></p>
