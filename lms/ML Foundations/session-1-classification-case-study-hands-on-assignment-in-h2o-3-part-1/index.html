        <h2 is-upgraded>Objective</h2>
<p>This is <strong>Part 1</strong> of a 2-part exercise wherein you are required to complete a case study pertaining to classification machine learning problems using the open-source machine learning platform, <a href="https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o/" target="_blank">H2O-3</a>.</p>
<p>For Part 1 of this assignment, you will be using a subset of the Freddie Mac Single-Family dataset to try to predict whether or not a mortgage loan will be delinquent using H2O&#39;s GLM, Random Forest, and GBM models. You will first learn how to use these models for classification problems, and then see how to use H2O&#39;s grid search to tune the hyper-parameters of each model.</p>
<p><strong>Note: This tutorial has been completed on Aquarium, which is H2O.ai&#39;s cloud environment providing software access for workshops, conferences, and training. The labs in Aquarium have datasets, experiments, projects, and other content preloaded. If you use your version of H2O-3 or Driverless AI, you will not see preloaded content.</strong></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Statistics</li>
<li>An <a href="https://aquarium.h2o.ai/" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> Account to access H2O.ai&#39;s software on the AWS Cloud.  <ul>
<li>Need an <a href="https://aquarium.h2o.ai/" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> account? Follow the instructions in the next section <strong>Task 1 Create An Account &amp; Log Into Aquarium</strong> to create an account</li>
<li>Already have an Aquarium account? Log in and continue to <strong>Task 2: Case Study - Classification</strong> to begin your exercise!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Task 1: Create An Account &amp; Log Into Aquarium</h2>
<p>Navigate to the following site: https://aquarium.h2o.ai/login and do the following:</p>
<p>1. create a new account (if you don&#39;t have one)</p>
<p>2. log into the site with your credentials.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to the lab: <strong><em>H2O-3 and Sparkling Water Test Drive</em></strong>. Click on Start Lab and wait for your instance to be ready. Once your instance is ready, you will see the following screen:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="labs-urls" src="img/745d21efb7c0b4fb.jpg"></p>
<p>Click on the Jupyter URL to start a Jupyter Notebook or the H2O Flow instance( if required). You can create a new Jupyter Notebook and follow the steps defined below.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Task 2: Case Study - Classification</h2>
<p>Open the following tutorial: <a href="https://training.h2o.ai/products/1a-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-h2o-3-classification" target="_blank">1A. Introduction to Machine Learning with H2O-3 - Classification</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In this exercise, you will follow the steps in the above tutorial and use H2O&#39;s GLM, Random Forest, and GBM models to try to predict whether or not a mortgage loan will be delinquent or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Now that you have completed the above case study you can now proceed on to attempt the <strong>ML Foundations: Module 3 Session 1: Dive into Supervised Learning with H2O-3 - Regression Case Study Hands-On Assignment in H2O-3.</strong></p>
